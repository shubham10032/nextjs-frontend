                                            <p>An equipment loan is a type of financial agreement that lends you money for the
                                                purchase of any sort of business equipment or machinery. The bank will provide
                                                you with a fixed amount of money, which can be used to purchase your new or used
                                                business equipment. Then the borrower will have to repay this amount over time

                                                as a "revolving line of credit." In a Revolving line of credit, once you've made
                                                all your payments on time, any remaining funds in your account can be used again
